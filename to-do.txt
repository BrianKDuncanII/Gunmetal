13. Improve the visuals of the game. (Add more color, better lighting, etc.)
14. Add a shop system where the player can buy items and upgrades.
15. Animate the bullets firing so gunplay feels more impactful and exciting.
16. There should be a way to cancel firing mode, probably by using 'escape' or something similar.
17. Look function with the 'L' key that allows you to look around and get info for tiles.
18. Add randomized spread for weapons, so they sometimes will miss enemies depending on the range from the enemy and the accuracy of the weapon.
19. Add an inventory capacity limit.
20. Add a way to drop items from the inventory.

Current Issues:
3. Investigate type error in the console. "TypeError: can't access property "then", a.default.detectStore(...) is undefined h1-check.js:1:1301"
4. When the player clicks "restart" on the game over screen, it doesn't remove the game over GUI.
5. Magazine and bullet shell particles don't spawn next to the player's position.
